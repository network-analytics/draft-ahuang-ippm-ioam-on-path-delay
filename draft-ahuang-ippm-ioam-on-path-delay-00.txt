1.  Introduction

   Network operators need to mesure the On-Path delay accross their
   network to monitor the proper functionning of their infrastructure
   and applications.  The On-Path delay can be computed using IOAM
   [RFC9197] with both Passport-mode and Postcard-mode.  In both cases,
   a time reference is needed.  In Passport-mode, a timestamp can be
   added into the data-field and in Postcard-mode, IOAM Direct Export
   [RFC9326] can be used with [I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext] to add
   a timestamp into the header.

   To allow the export of the On-Path delay, new data fields are
   necessary in the IOAM environment.  This document defines a new field
   in the IOAM architecture to support the export of the delay across
   the IOAM domain.

Internet-Draft           On-path delay for IOAM            February 2023


2.  Solution overview

   The IOAM Trace-Type Data-fields are defined in Section 4.4.2
   [RFC9197].  These Data-fields allow exporting telemetry data in both
   IOAM Trace-Type Option [RFC9197] and IOAM DEX Option [RFC9326].  In
   IOAM Trace-Type option, the delay can be added at each transit node
   and decapsulation node using the Pre-allocated and Incremental Trace-
   Option header and can be exported using
   [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport].  In IOAM DEX Option [RFC9326],
   using a Postcard-mode approach, the delay can be exported to a
   collector using IPFIX [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-on-path-telemetry]
   allowing to aggregate the On-path delay in the IPFIX exporter on the
   transit and decapsulation node.

   The On-path delay has been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-on-path-telemetry] using performance metrics
   [RFC8911].  The delay is computed between the encapsulated node in
   the IOAM domain and the transit or decapsulating node as shown in
   Figure 1.  The computed delays in Figure 1 are computed as following:

   *  D1: delay between the Encapsulation node R1 and the Transit node
      R2.

   *  D2: delay between the Encapsulation node R1 and the Transit node
      R3.

   *  D3: delay between the Encapsulation node R1 and the Decapsulation
      node R4.

Internet-Draft           On-path delay for IOAM            February 2023


       Figure 1: On-path delay use case.  Packets flow from host 1 to
                                  host 2.

   This document proposes a new 32-bit field allowing the export of the
   On-Path delay using IOAM.  The new Data-field is allocated by IANA,
   as defined in Section 5.

2.1.  On-Path delay Data-field

   The "On-Path Delay" field is a 4-octet unsigned integer field.  This
   field indicates the on-path delay between the encapsulation node and
   the transit or decapsulation node mesured in microseconds.

3.  Use Cases

   Possible interesting On-Path delay measurement use cases in
   combination with other key metrics is described in Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-on-path-telemetry].

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the IOAM Trace-Type and IOAM DEX
   Option-type are defined in [RFC9197] and in [RFC9326].  This document
   adds no additional security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to add the following bit in the "IOAM
   Trace-Type" Registry.

  Bit: 12
  Description: On-path delay between the encapsulated node and the transit or decapsulating node.
