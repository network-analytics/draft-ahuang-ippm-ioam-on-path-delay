1.  Introduction

   Network operators need to mesure the On-Path delay accross their
   network to monitor the proper functionning of their infrastructure
   and applications.

   In this draft, we propose to export delay measurement results based
   on the timestamp seconds and timestamp fractions fields of the IOAM
   data fields.

   In Passport-mode, the reference timestamp is obtained from IOAM
   Trace-type Data-Field.  In Postcard-mode, using IOAM Direct Export
   [RFC9326], [I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext] can be used to add a
   timestamp into the header.

   This document introduces a data field in the IOAM architecture to
   export delay information.  It uses a bit in the IOAM Trace-type field
   to request exporting nodes to include delay measurement in the
   exported data.

Internet-Draft           On-Path delay for IOAM            February 2023


2.  Solution overview

   The on-path delay is computed between the encapsulation node in the
   IOAM domain and the transit or decapsulation node as shown in
   Figure 1.  The calculated delays in Figure 1 are computed as
   following:

   *  D1: delay between the Encapsulation node R1 and the Transit node
      R2.

   *  D2: delay between the Encapsulation node R1 and the Transit node
      R3.

   *  D3: delay between the Encapsulation node R1 and the Decapsulation
      node R4.

                                  host 2.

   In IOAM, this delay can be exported in Passport-mode using Pre-
   allocated Trace-Option and Incremental Trace-Option as defined in
   [RFC9197] or in Postcard-mode using IOAM DEX Option as defined in
   [RFC9326].

   In Section 2.1 we describe how the delay can be computed using the
   existing Trace-Type Data-Fields and in Section 2.2 we describe how
   the delay can be exported with a timestamp extension.

Internet-Draft           On-Path delay for IOAM            February 2023


2.1.  Using IOAM Trace-Option

   In Passport-mode, telemetry data is added to the data-plane packet at
   each node of the IOAM-domain and all collected metrics are exported
   by the decapsulation node.

   Pre-allocated Trace Option-type and Incremental Trace Option-type is
   used to transport the different metrics.  The exported metrics are
   defined by the Bit-field IOAM Trace-Type as defined in Section 4.4.1
   of [RFC9197].

   To compute the delay at the transit and decapsulation node, a
   timestamp reference from the encapsulation node needs to be added.
   Bit 2 (timestamp seconds) and Bit 3 (timestamp fraction) from the
   IOAM Trace-type field [RFC9197] can be used for this purpose and at
   each node, the on-path delay can be computed using the delay from the
   encapsulation node and the current node.

   To export the on-path delay, a new bit in the IOAM Trace-Type Bit-
   field is needed.  Section 3 defines the Data-Field.

   To export the on-path delay metrics,
   [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport] can be used to collect raw IOAM
   data.

2.2.  Using IOAM DEX Option

   In Postcard-mode, telemetry data is exported at the transit nodes and
   decapsulation node of the IOAM domain.  The telemetry data can be
   aggregated at each node before being exported to a collector.

   DEX Option-type, as defined in [RFC9326], is used for this purpose.
   The exported telemetry data is defined in IOAM Trace-Type Bit-field
   and to support the export of the on-path delay, the new field defined
   in Section 3 is used.

   The timestamp reference needs to be added to the IOAM DEX Option-type
   header.  [I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext] defines an extension to
   allow adding the timestamp in the encapsulation node.  Bit 2
   (timestamp seconds) and Bit 3 (timestamp fraction) from the IOAM DEX
   Extension-Flags, defined in [I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext], are
   used to add this time reference.  At each transit and decapsulation
   node, the difference between the timestamp in the header and the
   current timestamp is computed.

   To export the aggregated on-path delay metrics, IPFIX can used with
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-on-path-telemetry].  This allows aggregation
   before the export.

3.  On-Path delay Data-field

   The "On-Path Delay" field is a 4-octet unsigned integer field.  This
   field indicates the on-path delay between the encapsulation node and
   the transit or decapsulation node mesured in microseconds.

   The Data-Field is allocated by IANA, as defined in Section 5.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the IOAM Trace-Type and IOAM DEX
   Option-type are defined in [RFC9197] and in [RFC9326].  This document
   adds no additional security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to add the following bit in the "IOAM
   Trace-Type" Registry.

    Bit: 12
    Description: On-path delay between the encapsulated node and the
                 transit or decapsulation node measured in microseconds.
