1.  Introduction

   Network operators want to measure the On-Path delay of the customers
   packets across their networks to determine where how much delay has
   been accumulated for a given application to optimize and maintain
   their networks.

   This document proposes an IOAM Trace-Type data field and its
   associated bit field to export delay measurements.  The delay
   measurements is obtained in passport-based IOAM based on the
   "timestamp seconds" and "timestamp fractions" Trace-Type data fields
   defined in [RFC9197].  In postcard-based IOAM the delay is obtained
   using the timestamp extensions defined in
   [I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext].

   Section 3 describes the suggested solution and Section 4 describes
   the proposed IOAM data field.

Internet-Draft           On-Path delay for IOAM            February 2023


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms as defined in
   [RFC9197].

   *  IOAM-domain

   *  IOAM encapsulation node

   *  IOAM transit node

   *  IOAM decapsulation node

3.  Solution overview

   The On-path delay is computed between the encapsulation node and the
   transit or decapsulation node of the IOAM-domain as shown in
   Figure 1.  The calculated delays in Figure 1 are computed as
   following:

   *  D1: delay between the encapsulation node R1 and the transit node
      R2.

   *  D2: delay between the encapsulation node R1 and the transit node
      R3.

   *  D3: delay between the encapsulation node R1 and the decapsulation
      node R4.

Internet-Draft           On-Path delay for IOAM            February 2023


       Figure 1: On-path delay use case.  Packets flow from host 1 to
                                  host 2.

   In passport-based IOAM this delay is exported using Pre-allocated
   Trace-Option and Incremental Trace-Option as defined in [RFC9197] or
   in postcard-based IOAM using IOAM DEX Option as defined in [RFC9326].

   Section 3.1 describes how the delay is computed using the existing
   Trace-Type data fields and Section 3.2 describes how the delay can be
   calculated using a timestamp extension.

3.1.  Using IOAM Trace-Option

   In passport-based IOAM, telemetry data is added to the data-plane
   packet at each node of the IOAM-domain and all collected metrics are
   exported by the decapsulation node.

   Pre-allocated Trace Option-type and Incremental Trace Option-type, as
   defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC9197], is used to transport the
   different metrics.  The exported metrics are defined by the bit field
   in IOAM Trace-Type as defined in Section 4.4.1 of [RFC9197].

   To compute the delay at the transit and decapsulation node, a
   timestamp reference from the encapsulation node needs is added.  Bit
   2 (timestamp seconds) and bit 3 (timestamp fraction) from the IOAM
   Trace-type field [RFC9197] is used for this purpose and at each node,
   the On-path delay is computed using the delay from the encapsulation
   and the current node.

   To export the On-path delay, a new bit in the IOAM Trace-Type bit
   field is required.  Section 4 defines the data field.

   To export the On-path delay metrics,
   [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport] is used to collect raw IOAM data.

3.2.  Using IOAM DEX Option

   In postcard-based IOAM, telemetry data is exported at the transit
   nodes and decapsulation node of the IOAM domain.  The telemetry data
   is aggregated at each node before being exported to a collector.

   DEX Option-type, as defined in [RFC9326], is used for this purpose.
   The exported telemetry data is defined in IOAM Trace-Type bit field.
   The export of the On-path delay is based on the On-Path Delay field
   defined in Section 4.

Internet-Draft           On-Path delay for IOAM            February 2023


   The timestamp reference needs to be added to the IOAM DEX Option-type
   header.  [I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext] defines an extension to
   allow the timestamp being added in the encapsulation node.  Bit 2
   (timestamp seconds) and bit 3 (timestamp fraction) from the IOAM DEX
   Extension-Flags, defined in [I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext], are
   used to add this time reference.  At each transit and decapsulation
   node, the difference between the timestamp in the header and the
   current timestamp is computed.

   To export the aggregated On-path delay metrics, IPFIX can be used
   with [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-on-path-telemetry].  This allows data
   aggregation before the export.  Raw IOAM DEX Option data can also be
   exported using [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport].

4.  On-Path delay Data-field

   The "On-Path Delay" field type is a 4-octet unsigned integer.  This
   field indicates the On-path delay between the encapsulation node and
   the transit or decapsulation node measured in microseconds.

   The Data-Field is allocated by IANA, as defined in Section 6.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the IOAM Trace-Type and IOAM DEX
   Option-type are defined in [RFC9197] and in [RFC9326].  This document
   adds no additional security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to add the following bit in the "IOAM
   Trace-Type" Registry.

    Bit: [TBD]
    Description: On-path delay between the encapsulated node and the
                 transit or decapsulation node measured in microseconds.
